     Direct estimation of TRFs over the source space
     MEG/EEG analysis tools 
     Engineered for neural source TRF estimation
     
The magnetoencephalography (MEG) response to continuous auditory stimuli, such as speech, is commonly described using a 
linear filter, the auditory temporal response function (TRF). Though components of the sensor level TRFs have been well 
characterized, the cortical distributions of  the underlying neural responses are not well-understood. In our recent 
work, we provide a unified framework for determining the TRFs of neural sources directly from the MEG data, by 
integrating the TRF and distributed forward  source models into one, and casting the joint estimation task as a 
Bayesian optimization problem. Though the resulting  problem emerges as non-convex, we propose efficient solutions 
that leverage recent advances in evidence maximization. For more details please refer to the following resources:
